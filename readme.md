segment16
=========

segment16 is a project to add client side visualization to [blinky](https://github.com/dkulla/blinky). It uses the power and flexibility of [d3js](http://d3js.org/) to create dynamic visualizations of [sixteen segment displays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen-segment_display). Ultimately, the functionality will be integrated into the blinky project, but I'm keeping them separate while I prototype it out.
